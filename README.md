## Alphabet-project

This program converts a user-inputted word into a sequence of words based on the NATO phonetic alphabet. For each letter in the input, the program looks up and outputs the corresponding NATO phonetic term, creating a set of phonetic words that spell out the original word letter by letter.

### A Table of Contents

1. **Imports**
   - Details on the Python module imported (`pandas`).

2. **Data Loading**
   - Description of how the NATO phonetic alphabet CSV file is loaded into a DataFrame.

3. **Dictionary Creation**
   - Explanation of the creation of `phonetic_dict`, mapping each letter to its corresponding NATO phonetic code.

4. **Phonetic Generation Function**
   - Overview of the `generate_phonetic` function, which converts user-inputted words into their phonetic counterparts.
   - Handling of user input and conversion to uppercase.
   - Error handling for non-alphabetical characters.

5. **User Interaction**
   - Description of how the program interacts with the user, prompting for input and displaying the phonetic codes.

6. **Error Handling**
   - Explanation of the try-except block within `generate_phonetic` for managing non-alphabetical inputs.

7. **Function Execution**
   - Details on the call to `generate_phonetic` that initiates the user interaction process.
